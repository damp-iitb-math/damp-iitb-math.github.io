    "courseStructure": "The prof aimed the course in the direction of harmonic analysis on lie groups. Thus the entire course was geared towards proving the Peter-Weyl theorem. Followed the book by Faraut",
    "overallReview": "To be very fair, until Peter-Weyl theorem is done, the course gives close to zero motivation as to why Lie groups are studied. We study a lot of abstract theorems about Lie algebras and Lie groups, yet their applications to other areas of mathematics like geometry or number theory, are immensely understated, and most students take the course as they have no other option. Would not recommend taking unless pure math enthu. Of course my advice will depend on the instructor.",

So in my rendition of the course, We did a few results from spectral graph theory, then went on to theorems on cayley graphs. Used Rep theory to find eigenvalues of cayley graphs. Proved existence of expanders. Cheeger's inequality, Symmetric function theory from Stanley Volume 2.",
    "overallReview": "The classes were very fun and interactive, and Prof. krishnan would make sure that everyone is aware of what is happening. The small batch size was good as well. Lead to a lot of discussion with the prof. The prof had a very nice selection of topics, and the proofs were quite beautiful. One review that I have is that the exams would involve memory of large proofs that was done in class, and this was quite annoying as I came expecting problem solving in the tests, unprepared for the large proofs. This messed up my grade, however I did learn a lot in the coruse. The prof is quite amenable to feedback, and if everyone feels a certain way about the tests, he was open to change. I would highly recommend auditing the course for an Undergraduate, if you are someone who doesn't really care about grades, then I would recommend taking.",

    "overallReview": "Excellent course, the professor is quite lucid and covered almost all topics exhaustively. He also stuck to the book on Probability by Varadhan which made the course easy to follow and study for. Good conceptual clarity and knowledge imparted by the end of it, especially compared to Baskar's SI427. Being a PhD course it is proof heavy and goes deep in the subject but the exams are very reasonable and brutally long theory proofs aren't asked, which makes exam prep tolerable as well. Simple memorisation isn't sufficient you have to think as well which makes it fun. Overall a good course for anyone interested in exploring probability or discrete maths.",

    "softPrereqs": "Almost every UG math core course, except PDE/Functional/Alg1. Some measure theory, but can be self learnt quickly. Don't take if multivariable calculus was a problem. This course is MVC +topology on steroids, would recommend taking only after algebraic topology",
    "courseStructure": "First 60% of the course does smooth manifold theory ending with stokes theorem on manifolds. Book used was smooth manifolds by Lee- Did upto chapter 18, skipping unnecessary parts. Then went to derham cohomology and thom isomorphism theorems",
    "overallReview": "first 60% of the course, will feel okay, since its just an extension of MVC. but once derham cohomology starts, the motivation lies in algebraic topology and thus it will seem quite unintuitive. I made the mistake of taking this course before algebraic topology, and suffered quite a bit. The assignments had nice problems, which can be quite hard if you don't understand the material. This was a main problem for me, as the constructs can be quite hard to grasp, so proving theorems on them is an even bigger challenge. I luckily caught up before the final exam, and the final exam was open book, which was quite relaxing. I ended up taking an allnighter for the exam, the paper had 6 problems, since I was weak in theory, i had to re-read the theory for each problem, then took about 30 mins to solve each problem, so it felt a little bit like an olympiad exam where ull have to read the theory as well. Final note is I would recommend taking the course if atleast one of the two hold a) You thoroughly understood the final part of MVC(stokes theorem on manifolds) b) You have some working knowledge of fundamental groups and homology theory from alg top",

Topics covered included Topological Vector Spaces, Hahn-Banach theorems, weak topologies, the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem, and compact operators. I have no idea how the lectures were because I never attended them, but the assignments were basically a bunch of problems from the textbook, and sometimes quite unreasonable ones. The midsemester examination was quite straightforward, but that was compensated in part by the difficulty of the endsemester examination. The grading was absolute with slabs of size 10 descending from 90-99 for an AA (100 was reserved for an AP).",

There was no single textbook followed, but the instructor would sporadically upload notes on Moodle. Broadly, we covered distributions from Rudin's Functional Analysis, and the theory of Sobolev spaces and semigroups from Evans' Partial Differential Equations. Overall, it was a well-taught course, although it would've been nicer to have a clear goal of what the theory aims to achieve, but I believe that's mainly attributed to my own ignorance of this field. The grading was very generous, with the professor awarding significant points to partial solutions on the exam. I'd recommend taking this course if you enjoyed MA515.",

The course textbook was Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry of which we were able to finish Sections 1 through 5 of Chapter II, i.e., sheaves, schemes and various properties thereof, separated and proper morphisms (highlight: valuative criteria), and sheaves of modules which ended in the computation of cohomologies of the projective space (which is technically Chapter III material). Parallelly the instructor ran a ``seminar'' on the theory of compact Riemann surfaces. Crediting students were encouraged to give talks in the seminar which factored into their final grades. The ``seminar'' met once a week (except during exam weeks) and ended with the Riemann-Roch theorem and Serre duality one week before the endsems. Everyone (3 people) ended up getting AAs",
